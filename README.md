# Bus_Resrvation_SystemBus Reservation  System Project In Java SpringBoot And Angular
Bus Reservation  System Project In Java SpringBoot And Angular. We have developed this project on the basis of a real-time scenario.
It is a full-stack project containing all the features for accadmic and those willing to learn new technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Angular, etc.
The features of this project are automated and structured. The technologies used in the front end are Angular, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The design part of this application is unique. Everything is created from scratch. Spring Boot is the processing layer of the application or you can say the backend.
As we know, as per Oracle, the least stable version of java is Java 8. So we have used the same.
You will see many features of Java 8 in the project like lambda expression, stream API, java date and time, etc.
It is a good learning opportunity for you. As we have already discussed that in the front end we are using Angular, but it is a client-side framework, so for the server-side, we have used spring boot. Spring boot internally uses tomcat as a server. So no need to install the Apache server externally on your machine. Spring is incomplete without maven. We have used maven as a project management tool.
It is one of the most popular frameworks in the current industry. It is popularly known for Rest API. We have also used spring security for secure communication between client and server.
Mysql is used for the database. It will communicate to the server or rest services using hibernate and JPA.
Let’s discuss the tools which are used to develop this project. Front-end technology is developed on the visual studio code. It is one of the most popular IDE for front-end development. It gives you an automated feature to complete your task more quickly.
And to develop the spring part, we have used Spring Tool Suite as an IDE. It is a special version of eclipse which is specially designed to develop Spring projects. It is the advanced version of Eclipse IDE.
